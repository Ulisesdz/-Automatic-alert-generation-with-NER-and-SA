LONDON 1996-12-06,1,1
The British government warned Friday that it would refer the proposed trans-Atlantic alliance between British Airways Plc and American Airlines to Britain Monopolies and Mergers Commission unless the carriers complied with a number of conditions .,0,0
"Trade and Industry Secretary Ian Lang added that even if the conditions were met by both airlines , final clearance would hinge on an open skies deal between Britain and the United States to liberalise trans-Atlantic air traffic , which would create greater competition on the routes .",1,0
"Lang said he supported conditions proposed by Britain s""                  examine the case last month .",1,1

His comments came just minutes after the latest set of open skies talks ended in London with no deal signed .,0,1
Industry sources said there was no new date for fresh talks and blamed the deadlock on uncertainty over whether the British Airways-American deal would be cleared .,0,0
"The conditions for clearance of the alliance were that British Airways and American drop 168 slots at London Heathrow airport , the busiest in Europe .",0,1
"American s""                  view the terms as a "" deal breaker . """,1,1
"However , it called the conditions "" more severe "" than those imposed by other regulatory authorities on similar airline alliances .",0,1
"British Airways s""          unconditional divestiture of slots is unprecedented and if done it must be on the basis of fair market value . """,0,1
"It added that it would be "" prepared to take reasonable steps to assist the introduction of additional competition . """,1,1
"The government also wants British Airways to drop a clause in its agreement with USAir that bars it from competing on trans-Atlantic routes , and said both British Airways and American should be prepared to reduce services on the London to Dallas-Fort Worth route in the event that a new entrant wishes to enter .",0,1

SINGAPORE 1996-12-06,1,1
"Singapore s""              Organisation ( WTO ) s""      reflected its ambition to play a key role in shaping global free trade , the lifeblood of its economy , analysts said .",1,1
""" As one of the world s""      economies , Singapore has a disproportionately large stake in the WTO , "" said Desmond Supple , economist at research house I.D.E.A .",0,0
""" Singapore stands to benefit more than most from continued global trade liberalisation as trade is the engine of its growth , accounting for nearly three times its gross domestic product . """,1,1
"The city-state met U.S. opposition two years ago in its bid to host the meeting , expected to gather 4,000 officials from 160 countries from December 9 to 13 .",0,0
"In a stand some analysts linked to controversy over Singapore s""            vandalism , then-U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor had said the meeting ought to be held where the WTO was going to be headquartered .",0,1
That would have meant Geneva .,0,1
But Singapore had the support of other WTO members .,1,1
"Derek da Cunha , senior fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies ( ISEAS ) , said Singapore s""  of the conference "" carries a great deal of symbolism for the city-state , underscoring its commitment to free trade and its trading links across the globe . """,1,1
"There is the international prestige Singapore would enjoy , but "" more importantly there is a genuine national interest in fostering better global free trade and an open market "" , said Tan Kong Yam , head of Business Policy at the National University of Singapore .",1,0
"At the ministerial meeting , trade ministers will review the work of the WTO and the implementation of the Uruguay Round free trade commitments under its predecessor the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) .",1,1
"In June , the WTO hailed Singapore for its open market policies but the European Union and other trading powers called on Singapore to speed up the opening of its services sector .",1,1
Supple said the struggle that Singapore had to wage in vying to host the meeting would be repeated during the talks .,0,1
""" There is tension at every step of the way , "" since a battle line between the West and developing countries has been drawn over the issue of linking trade liberalisation with labour rights , he said .",1,1
"Supple said hosting the meeting carried prestige for Singapore , "" however , this is quite intangible as the prestige factor may not necessarily lead to any additional investment and trade flows to this region . """,1,1
"From a commercial point of view , the meeting would be good for Singapore s""          .",0,1
"A large part of Singapore s""      mobilised to ensure the meeting would run without a glitch but the average Singaporean "" would probably not be too concerned about some of the issues , "" Tan said .",1,1
""" But the more educated public will realise that these kind of things are important for Singapore as a small economy . """,1,1
Supple said any political gains the Singapore government would get from the WTO meeting -- ahead of a general election due by April 1997 -- would depend on how successful it was in pushing its economic agenda .,0,1
""" If there are any movements toward freer trade , then Singapore s""            , "" he said . """,0,1
